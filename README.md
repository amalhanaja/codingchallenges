# Coding challenges
These great challenges are published at https://codingchallenges.fyi by John Cricket. 

I decided to implement it in Rust.

I love the most the real world applications as Redis, load balancer, webserver, IRC client, json parse, url shortener and more to come ....

# Build Your Own
You can find all my implementation,

# Special Thanks
Special thanks to John Cricket for these challenges and I encourage every Engineer from Junior to Principal to do this. Learn a new language or get back to language you have used to code (as me here who learn Rust).

And also learn to understand real-world applications while writing my own version of it.
